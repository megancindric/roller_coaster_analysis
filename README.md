### Roller Coaster Data Analysis

The following is an analysis of popular roller coasters from around the world. The datasets contain information about the winners of the Golden Ticket Award for best **steel** and best **wooden** roller coaster. My goal is to determine **what is the ideal combination of roller coaster properties that make for a popular attraction?**, and also determine **which amusement park would be the best candidate to sell this roller coaster to?**

First, we will clean each data set individually, before combining into a single data set that combines each coaster with it's associated properties, as well as identifies if it is a steel or wooden machine.
